          <h3>Executive overview</h3>
          <p>The Code for America team and the City of Charlotte have been working together for the past year to push towards several important outcomes. Working hand-in-hand with both the Innovation &amp; Technology Department and the Neighborhood &amp; Business Services Department to further the City Manager’s mission of community and citizen engagement, we:</p>
          <ul class="bullet">
            <li>created Citygram as a demonstration project for the City’s new Open Data Portal,</li>
            <li>showcased an iterative, agile way of building software,</li>
            <li>illustrated the value of user research and how to do it, and</li>
            <li>communicated the concept and value of human-centered design.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>The city environment</h3>
          <p>When we arrived in Charlotte, the City had already begun preparing for the Fellowship and advancing a culture of of innovation by hosting a robust and comprehensive ideation session with over 60 city employees in January. As we conducted our discovery period during February through 40+ face-to-face meetings and gathered our own ideas, we started to see patterns and groupings amongst all of the topics. Together with our City partners and the <a href="http://codeforcharlotte.org" class="link-paragraph" target="_blank">Code for Charlotte</a> Brigade, we distilled over 300 ideas into several key categories. They included: Process Improvements, Citizens as Field Agents, Engagement Interfaces, Neighborhoods, Employee Engagement, Capital Improvement Projects, Planning, Inequality, Environment, and Transparency and Open Data.
            <br>
            <br>Also in January, the civic community in Charlotte exploded in an auspicious launch of the&nbsp;Brigade. Over the past eleven months, we’ve had the privilege of watching and supporting the growth of the Brigade to over 270 local members under the leadership of Jim van Fleet and Jill Bjers.
            <br>
            <br>In 2013 the City had already advanced work on a Open Data Policy and an Open Data Portal. The City recognized the value of transparency and that data in many departments was not always easily accessible. The goal of these efforts was to help open up these data sets for both internal city use and public access. Throughout the course of this year, the efforts around open data &nbsp;paralleled ours as together we City staff to understand not only the value of open data, but its wealth of effects and possibilities for citizen engagement.
            <br>
            <br>Overall, the timing was ripe for the Code for America fellows to enter and partner with the City on a variety of engagements.</p>

        <div class="w-col w-col-9">
          <h3>How the idea came to be</h3>
          <p>We learned so much from being inside City Hall, but we also made sure to spend time with Charlotte community members outside of City Hall. (Special thanks to the Knight School of Communication for helping to facilitate our interviews with Charlotte community members.) As we spoke to Charlotteans who were leaders of their neighborhoods, we found our conversations often centered around the following questions:</p>
          <ul class="bullet italics">
            <li>How do you find out about what’s happening in your neighborhood?</li>
            <li>How do you figure out what’s being planned?</li>
            <li>How do you discover what will happen in the near future for your area?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>And we heard:</p>
          <ul class="bullet italics">
            <li>We don’t. Hopefully we somehow find out before it affects us.</li>
            <li>Word of mouth while walking the dog.Reading the paper sometimes.</li>
            <li>Through the city website, if I know where to look.</li>
            <li>We have a rapport with a contact at the City who looks out for us, routes new businesses to us, and lets us know when things are on the way -- as a respectful check-in.</li>
            <li>Recently, we were added to the zoning info list. It doesn’t have a “push capability” -- it instead encourages us to ‘come back and check-in often.’ I don’t have the bandwidth.</li>
            <li>I need a better way to learn about things happening in my neighborhood. I want to know what’s coming so we can be proactive vs. reactive.</li>
          </ul><img class="journal-image" src="images/jan-tiffany-research.jpg" width="964" alt="5472cdc1c7a039b67406d6d2_jan-tiffany-research.jpg">
          <p class="paragraph-project paragraph-projects">What we realized is that even the most engaged community members had to <strong>go and seek out this information</strong> from a smattering of discrete channels in order to discover what was important to them and their neighborhood. At the same time, we saw from our discussions with departments that the City had so much rich data about plans and topics and events related to these exact questions. If the City had so much data, and citizens wanted to know, what could we do to address the gap and align the need with the City Manager’s community engagement strategy?</p>

          <h4>UNDERSTANDING The opportunity</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="w-col w-col-9"><img class="journal-image" src="images/brainstorming.jpg" width="768" alt="547d36529e4d1e7609d4bf5c_brainstorming.jpg">
          <p class="paragraph-project paragraph-projects">After researching the space with the Innovation &amp; Technology and Corporate Communications departments, we found that the City of Charlotte is communicating with their citizens in a lot of different ways, but gaps still existed. We saw an opportunity to help citizens better understand what’s going on in their area. By providing timely information to citizens in areas that are relevant to them, the City could be proactive instead of reactive, build trust through transparency, and increase civic engagement across the board.
            <br>
            <br>This opportunity dovetailed nicely with the City’s simultaneous push for open data. If Charlotte has a rich array of data that’s not easily discoverable, <strong>how can we make raw data not only open, but also meaningful to people?</strong> Even more importantly: how could we connect Charlotte’s two strategic initiatives, open data and citizen engagement? <strong>How can open data be a platform for community engagement?</strong>

            <br>With Citygram, citizens can choose a topic of interested &nbsp;(which is powered by a department’s open data feed), enter an address (perhaps home or work), select the area that’s important , and decide how to be notified (text message or email).

          <p class="paragraph-project paragraph-projects">Citygram is a web application that connects to the City's open data platform, and is designed to work with any open government data. A citizen designates area(s) of a city they are interested in and subscribes to one or more topics, and when an event for a desired topic occurs in the subscriber's area, a notification (email, SMS, or webhook) is delivered. To create the notifications, the application regularly checks for new data and transforms it into human speak according to a customizable template.

        </div>
        <div class="w-col w-col-9">
          <p class="paragraph-project paragraph-projects">During the second half of the year, Citygram became a shared project of two teams. The <a class="link-paragraph" target="_blank" href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/lexington/">Lexington team</a> (Livien Yin, Erik Schwartz, Lyzi Diamond) encountered similar needs and challenges with location-relevant open data in Lexington, and offered indispensable and complementary skill sets and perspectives. As such, the Charlotte team joined forces with the Lexington team to drive the development of Citygram.
            <br>
            <br>In July, we embarked on a sequence of <a class="link-paragraph" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/citygram/wiki">user research efforts</a> to push the project forward while departments in Charlotte were working to make their data open and available for Citygram to consume. We conducted a three-week user test in Seattle with the help of the Code for Seattle brigade, which helped us to understand the end-to-end experience of receiving notifications from open data. Soon after, we conducted a follow up three-week user test in Lexington, to answer outstanding use case questions and usability questions.
            <br>
            <br>The close collaboration and the learnings that ensued became one the richest growing experiences of the year for both teams. The Charlotte team would like to extend their appreciation to the Lexington team -- without them, Citygram would not be where it is today.</p><img class="journal-image" src="images/mixer-maps2.jpg" width="910" alt="547d34e839b0bf7409a2fcff_mixer-maps2.jpg">

                <li class="numbered"><strong>Curation.</strong> There’s an incredible wealth of data floating around in open data portals (for instance: liquor licenses in Washington, trees planted in San Francisco) — enough that we constantly heard, “wow…my city can tell me X?” But not every data feed is right for Citygram. We learned in Seattle that while people might be highly interested in rezonings, no one cares very much about electrical permits. As curators of open data, we must strike a balance between useful and too noisy. We’ve tried to allow for the citizen to self-select those boundaries via our user experience design.</li>
                <li class="numbered"><strong>Translation.</strong> It’s incredibly important to turn data (”machine speak”) into human speak. For instance, we started with traffic incidents in upper case (“scream case”) in Charlotte. Receiving those texts was not a great user experience.</li>
                <li class="numbered"><strong>People want to know about their surroundings.</strong> &nbsp;<em class="numbered">“I live on my own, and because of that, staying more informed about my neighborhood and what goes on there 1) reassures me about the overall safety of my 'hood, 2) makes me feel like I'm a little more in control because of it, and 3) provides the info in a low-impact, contextualized way that's easy to consume.”</em> -Jodi, Seattle</li>

Since Citygram is largely a communication channel for existing data feeds, the organization as a whole must understand the value of open data before people can understand the need for communicating it.</li>
                <li class="numbered"><strong>Citygram is not a custom notifications platform.</strong>&nbsp;It’s not for emergencies. It is not for departments to manually craft messages to send out to the masses. It’s a simple, automated channel of communication for data that that originates in business systems and is available in a live feed.</li>
                <li class="numbered"><strong>Applications built on top of open data portals are only as good as the data that’s in them. </strong>If the data is low-quality or incomplete, delivering that to citizens won’t make it any better — in fact, it will probably confuse them even more.</li>
                <li class="numbered"><strong>Trust.</strong> Just as fellowship cities are instructed to trust the CfA process, the fellows need to trust the city partner in navigating the political minefield.

As such, we do not yet have metrics on usage and engagement of Citygram in Charlotte specifically.
                <br>
                <br>We do, however, have evidence of an overwhelming amount of community interest in Citygram. Since Charlotte’s presentation at the Code for America Summit in late September, over thirty individuals (both brigades and local governments) have declared interest in Citygram. BetaNYC, the New York brigade, forked their own Citygram.nyc less than three weeks after the Summit and has presented it in city council testimony to argue for the need and value for open data. Brigades in San Francisco, Salt Lake City, Tulsa, and the municipalities of St. Louis, St. Paul, Houston, and Denton, TX are among the parties who have reached out, clamoring for a way to bring Citygram to their city.</p>

              <p class="paragraph-project paragraph-projects">Moving forward, we’re proud to say that Citygram in Charlotte will be maintained and supported by the Code for Charlotte Brigade. Our team and the City of Charlotte built the architecture of Citygram with an eye towards scalability across cities, and we hope for further exploration of Citygram as a product. There is still a plethora of unanswered questions, including:</p>
              <ul class="bullet">
                <li>Who is the key Citygram user? Does Citygram fulfill a distinct user need?</li>
                <li>Can Citygram encourage increased citizen engagement? How can we measure that?</li>
                <li>What’s the best way to position Citygram to push forward open data in cities?</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="paragraph-project paragraph-projects">Deeper, more focused user research and development of features (for example, the ability for citizens to reply to notifications as a way to engage in a relevant conversation with their city) will be necessary to answer those questions. Continued work by Code for America on Citygram would allow the opportunity for the application to flourish and self-define as a product that is available for brigades, communities, and governments alike.</p>

              <p class="paragraph-project paragraph-projects">The Welcome Wagon project, one of our side initiatives as described in our <a class="link-paragraph" target="_blank" href="http://tchu88.github.io/charlotte-midyear/#projects">mid-year report</a>, began as a way to help new Charlotteans connect to their neighborhood organization. Since almost every new Charlotte resident moving in must turn on their water by calling 311, we saw a great opportunity for Charlotte’s Utilities and 311 departments to leverage their existing workflow and play a key role in putting citizens in touch with their neighborhood groups as a “welcome” to the city.
                <br>
                <br>Through the many discussions that were needed to kickstart this project, the process and deliverables became diluted as the year went on. A variety of factors contributed to this, including: stakeholder misalignment, technical constraints of legacy systems, lack of ownership from a single department, timing and bandwidth from stakeholders, and concerns around geographic coverage and contact information privacy.
                <br>
                <br>Instead, we’ve focused our efforts on helping support a draft of the Welcome Letter, as well as an improved intake process for the Neighborhoods Organization Contact List -- which will hopefully become linked in a citizen welcome process in the near future. We’re disappointed that the opportunity for this project to fully come to fruition during our fellowship year has passed, but we remain optimistic that we’ve sowed the seeds for a successful collaboration between Neighborhood &amp; Business Services, Corporate Communications, CharMeck 311, and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utilities to take the welcome project forward.</p>

          <h3>Favorite quotes from the year</h3>
          <p>It’s been quite a learning journey, and the words of encouragement along the way has helped us to remember why we do what we do, especially during the tougher moments.</p><img class="journal-image" src="images/seventh-st.jpg" width="952" alt="5472e11d69a1c3392835678f_seventh-st.jpg">
          <ul class="bullet not-italic">
            <li><em>“You showed us how to present our work in a whole new way. We don’t have to do the whole project at once. We can break it down into smaller chunks and do them one at a time.”</em> -Tom Warshauer,&nbsp;Community Engagement Manager, City of Charlotte</li>
            <li><em>“Thanks again for coming to my class this semester. The students are off working in the community now and said that your talk helped them prepare for their project.”</em> -Alexis Carreiro, Visiting Professor at Queens University, Knight School of Communication</li>
            <li><em>“Today, the brigade is working on approximately ten projects with partners directly in the City.”</em> -Jill Bjers, Code for Charlotte Brigade Co-Captain</li>
            <li><em>“Thank you for your guidance this morning! YOU ARE AWESOME! You truly helped Steve and I re-organize this project in a way that is pleasing to our audience.”</em> -Angie Gover, Stephen Wood, Neighborhood and Business Services, City of Charlotte</li>
            <li><em>“One emergent outcome is that we’ve started to shape a culture of innovation, where each employee has responsibility for creative solutions, rather than sanctioning a dedicated team.”</em> -Twyla McDermott, Corporate IT Manager, City of Charlotte</li>
            <li><em>“The Citygram application was developed by Charlotte's 2014 Fellowship team as an exhibition of the power of distributing open data relevant to citizens... The City of Charlotte is very proud.”</em> -Jim van Fleet, Code for Charlotte Brigade Co-Captain</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Final recommendations</h3>
          <p>As the City of Charlotte continues to establish a culture of innovation, we offer these eight concluding recommendations to sustain, maintain and grow their innovation environment for the future:</p>
          <ol class="lessons">
            <li class="numbered">Iteration over waterfall: fight the need to plan out every single detail of every single project plan and project charter.</li>
            <li class="numbered">Invite citizens in for continued user research for every citizen-facing project or initiative. If the project is internal and not citizen-facing, invite city employees for user research.</li>
            <li class="numbered">Invest in training for human-centered design for compelling application experiences and communications</li>
            <li class="numbered">Keep building momentum: If a department or stakeholder is not on board, make sure to craft a backup plan that can continue to move forward without their participation. Then, if they decide to participate later on, all momentum will not have halted.</li>
            <li class="numbered">Value action over planning and governance -- to first show what’s possible.</li>
            <li class="numbered">To avoid post open data portal launch fatigue and “so what”: make sure the data in the open data portal is supported by internal processes to remain consistently updated.</li>
            <li class="numbered">Continue to invest in strong relationships and pathways of communication between the City and the Code for Charlotte Brigade.</li>
            <li class="numbered">Test early and often with your users to make sure you’re building the right thing.</li>

      <h1>And lastly</h1>
      <p>We’d like to thank everyone from the City of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County who helped to make our work possible this year. We are especially grateful to Twyla and Tom, who believed in us, and who believed in Code for America’s mission: that government services can be simple, effective, and easy to use, and that government can work for the people, by the people in the 21st century.</p><img src="images/team-photo.jpg" width="1000" alt="5471178d569cb0861f638560_team-photo.jpg">
